      'After Manguito, (a peach faced lovebird) came to our home, several people were continuously asking me for pictures of him. That gave me the idea of making a personal website for him. In this website different users can post his pictures, comment about Manguito’s daily life, and share them with their friends and family.\nManguito Page is a MERN webapp with CRUD operations, with access to cloud storage to read, upload and delete image files. Manguito Page went through a few updates since its initial deployment, including debugging minor bugs, and updating the layout with a more modern design.\nManguito Page is fully functional on both desktop and mobile devices. User login is not needed to browse the images.',

      "The idea for this project came to me after listening to my wife's complaint of not being able to install any productivity apps on neither her work computer nor her work phone due to security reasons. All she wanted was just a simple planner that is accessible anywhere online, that can work on different platforms, and that would not require any installations. \nMango planner is a MERN webapp with basic CRUD operations, plus some convenience functionalities such as weather app, dark mode, and search bar. This app is fully functional in both desktop and mobile devices.",

      'This is my first work as a web developer. I updated the newspaper company’s website both visually and technically after it had been neglected for ages. The website is built on the WordPress platform. I reworked the website layout based on the company’s needs for ads and better legibility. I also improved its performance so that it would load faster and work properly in mobile devices. \n As a result, I reduced the page loading time by 50%, and got better feedback from site visitors. This tripled the daily traffic and led to more advertisement contracts (more ad revenue).',
